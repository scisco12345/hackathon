Idea : Malware proof Hard disk

Feature : Unaffected by virus attacks, unwanted encryption .

Model : Implemented by mimicking web server client model.

Data to write is sent to an intermediate mini computer device attached to hard disk which allocates memory on the hard disk to store file… since the user’s computer has no direct access to the hard disk no programs can write directly or wipe out the hard disk… In short  : reading is similar to sending request to server system and receiving file as response ( or download ).. Writing is similar to uploading file… The server system is replaced by a mini computing device attached to our hard disk….
